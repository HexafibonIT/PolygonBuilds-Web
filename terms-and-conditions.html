        <h5 class="tnc-heading">3. Ordering</h5>
        <p class="left para">
          <strong>(a) Placing an order.</strong> To order the 3D Model you designed or 
          another 3D Model you found through our Services, you select the 3D Model. 
          Then you can select the quantity of the 3D Model you order and, if applicable, the material you want the 
          3D Model to be made of. As the next step, we ask you to provide us with information we need for the delivery
          of the 3D Model. Finally you will be prompted for information required to initiate the payment. Depending 
          on the payment method you select you may be redirected to a third party payment provider website. Please 
          be informed that the language to be used during the whole ordering process is English.
      </p>
      <p class="left para">
          <strong>(b) Unacceptable orders,</strong> cancellation of orders by us. If a 3D Model is available through our Website, 
          the default assumption is that it can be produced. There are, however, technical or other reasons why 
          <Text style="color: #ffc107">PolygonBuilds</Text> may not accept or may cancel your order during the entire ordering process, even after our 
          acceptance of your order. Such reasons can be, but are not limited to, the unfeasibility of the model, 
          an infringing feature of your 3D Model (see our Content Policy), or the destination of the delivery you 
          indicated in your order. In case we cancel your partial or entire order, we will contact you via email and, 
          except in cases of fraud or other violations of our policies, issue you a full refund for the cancelled item(s).
